Use a shortcode to quickly insert product or service review disclaimers inside your posts.

== Description ==
Clearly disclose to your visitors that you will receive compensation for your review, or endorsement of a particular company, product, or service.

Recent changes to rules in the United States by the FTC, the United Kingdom by the OFT, and in other countries now require that bloggers disclose the fact that they were compensated (either monetarily  or through free products) for their reviews. 

On blogs that post paid reviews in addition to other tips, it is not useful to add a disclosure to every post that gets written. That would add a lot of unnecessary disclosures to your site and probably confuse some of your visitors. For that reason, the shortcode provided by this plugin will allow you to easily insert a small disclosure statement only to the blog posts or pages you want it added to. 

You may also want to add the disclosure right before, or after the actual endorsement, or referral link in the post. You can use this shortcode to add the disclosure anywhere within the body of your posts.

== Installation ==
1. Download archive and unzip in wp-content/plugins or install via Plugins – Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. In your WordPress dashboard, click on Settings > Review Disclaimer.
4. Type your disclaimer text into the box, and click Save Changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why Should I add a Disclaimer Inside my Post? =

When someone reads your reviews they do not necessarily know whether or not you were compensated, or if you went out and purchased the product and then decided to rave about it. Simply posting a disclaimer on a separate page does not inform the reader, who may not click on the disclaimer page. Even if they did click on it, the disclaimer page likely would not be clear as to what products or services you received compensation for.

From the FTC website "A single disclosure doesn’t really do it because people visiting your site might read individual reviews or watch individual videos without seeing the disclosure on your page."

Therefore, you should include a disclosure on every post that has a paid review.

= How do I insert a disclaimer in a page or post? =

In your WordPress dashboard, click on Settings > Review Disclaimer, then enter the disclaimer text and click Save Changes.

After you have saved the disclaimer text you can use the shortcode [ReviewDisclaimer] in any page or post where you want your disclaimer to appear.

= Is there Required Language to use in my Disclosure? =

No. As long as it is clear that you received compensation of some sort for your review. You could say something like:

I received compensation for my review of the products or services in this post.

= If I decide to change the language in the disclaimer later on, what will happen to the disclaimers currently being shown on my pages or posts? =

If you update the disclaimer, the shortcodes used in your pages or posts will update to reflect the new language. They will continue to be shown in the same location on the page as where you originally placed it.

If you delete the text, and still have the shortcode inside a page or post, it will simply remove the language from that page or post. 

== Screenshots ==
1. Easily insert and save your disclaimer text to insert into your pages and posts later.
2. Use shortcodes anywhere in your page or post to insert the disclaimer.
3. Your disclaimer is now in the body of your article to clearly identify that you are receiving compensation.
